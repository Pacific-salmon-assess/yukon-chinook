# yukon-chinook
Eventual home of a multi-CU integrated run-reconstruction and spawner-recruitment model that explicitly accounts for changes in the size, age, and sex of spawners over time. This model will draw from past work on Yukon Chinook population diverity ([Connors et al. 2022](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eap.2709?utm_sq=gqzx3u0l8q)) and incorporating demographic information into spawnerâ€“recruit analyses ([Staton et al. 2021](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0478))
