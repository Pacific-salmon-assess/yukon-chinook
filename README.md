# yukon-chinook
Eventual home of a multi-CU integrated run-reconstruction and spawner-recruitment model that explicitly accounts for changes in the size, age, and sex of spawners over time. This model will draw from past work on Yukon Chinook population diverity ((Connors et al. 2022))[] and incorporating demographic information into spawnerâ€“recruit analyses ((Staton et al. 2021))[https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0478]
